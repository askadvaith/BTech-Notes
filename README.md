# BTech Notes

Hiya! I'm Advaith, a first year BTech student at PES University, and these are my class notes! 
You'll find all the notes organised by semester and subject, and then further divided topic wise. I've tried my best to keep the notes informative and easy to read; hopefully you find them helpful :D

### A few things about this repository:
- I try to keep this repository updated as regularly as possible. You can expect it to be updated every 3-4 days; at the latest once a week.
- As of right now, you will find the Mechanics - Statics section empty. This is because I wasn't allowed to take digital notes in that class :/ I will upload my handwritten solutions at some point though!
- Some of my notes may not be completely finished/polished as I upload them initially, I usually mention this in the title of the note. It will be updated later as and when I get to it.
- These are just my class notes, in the way I like to take notes. What works for my method of studying may not work for yours, so just something to keep in mind :)
- If you find any issues with the notes (something missing/incorrect), or if you want anything else:
    - Raise an issue here in GitHub, or
    - Message/email me!
